# Corsac

command line tools for Firefox OS development

## Corsac goal

    - Corsac project is based on Mozilla Cuddlefish (a.k.a "cfx")
        - https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk/wiki/cfx-py
    - The ideia is provide a cool and productive cli for Web App developers.

### Getting Started

1. Install: `npm install -g corsac`
2. Run: 

### Dependencies

You're going to need [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/) to run those commands.

### Why the project is called 'corsac'

Corsac is a fox specie ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsac_fox)), and thinking in a tool for Firefox OS, nothing else cool to use that a fox :)
